# Summary

I, Joe Bob, am an absolute expert at everything. I graduated from High School with a 3.2 at 14, and worked at McDonalds until I was 32. I was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard in burger flipping. Needless to say, I'm highly qualified to work at any burger flipping establishment.

## In Conlclusion

I know a lot of things, you need someone who knows a lot of things. You should consider me for a job, because I know a lot of things. I know how to use Markdown, and I'm out of bubble gum. Beef is great and all but I'd enjoy something in the managerial position.

I also know how to spell **Hallelujah**, so I've got that going for me. Which is nice.
